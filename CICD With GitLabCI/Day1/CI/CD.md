# What is CI CD

## Lets start with CI
CI stands for continuous integration
CI is the practice od integrating code changes with other developers.
You do this but then you must build and test the project after each code change has been pushed.

So in summary CI, every changed made to a repo is integrated and tested. This will insure that after every change the project still works.

## CD Continuous Delivery
The idea is that once a project is built and is tested to check that it is still working, there is a program that can be delivered and staged only with the go-ahead of a human. The working product can then be sent in for production.
